Intelligent Customer Help Desk with Smart Document Understanding



A customer care chat bot that can answer all simple questions, such as store locations its whereabouts and hours,

directions, and perhaps even making appointments related to the Metro stores in Hyderabad. When a question falls outside of the scope 
of the bot it tries to maintain the queries of customers by re-quoting the various possibilities it can do, the option is typically to 
tell the customer that the question is not valid or offer to speak to a real person.

In this project,  there will be another option. If the customer question is about the operation of a device, the application shall pass
the question onto the Watson Discovery Service, which has been pre-loaded with the device’s owners manual. So now, instead of 
“Would you like to speak to a customer representative?” we can return the relevant sections of the owners manual to help solve our 
customers’ problems.

To take it a step further, the project shall use the Smart Document Understanding feature of Watson Discovery to train it on
what text in the owners manual is important and what is not. This will improve the answers returned from the queries.

This is just a basic model of it,we can build more accurate and more efficient
system that can be installed in the stores.
